# aw_emu
Allwinner low-level emulator, used for debugging baremetal payloads. Currently only Allwinner A133 is supported, other Allwinner SoC's are unsupported.

# Why?
I'm lazy, and this was easier than constantly testing my baremetal payloads on real hardware. I also could've implemented support for any Allwinner SoC I wanted to emulate into QEMU, but, I prefer emulating an SoC using the Unicorn framework, because it's simple.
